                        A short link is a condensed version of a long web address (URL) that is generated by a URL shortening service. These tiny URLs are designed to be more visually appealing, easily shareable, and suitable for platforms with character limitations, such as social media, text messages, and email. Short links are especially helpful when sharing content in situations where space is limited or where a clean, uncluttered appearance is desired.
